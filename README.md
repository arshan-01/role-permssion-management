# Permission Management System

Welcome to the Permission Management System project! This system provides a robust framework for managing module permissions, roles, and user access in both frontend and backend applications.

## Features

- **Module Creation**: Define modules with actions like create, delete, update.
- **Role Management**: Create roles and assign specific module actions to them.
- **Permission Assignment**: Map permissions to frontend and backend routes.
- **Access Control**: Enforce route access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Middleware Integration**: Implement backend middleware to validate permissions.

## Project Structure

### Modules

1. **Define Modules**:
   - Modules represent various features or entities (e.g., "Product Order").
   - Actions (e.g., create, delete, update) can be performed on these modules.

2. **Assign Actions**:
   - Specify actions that can be performed for each module.

### Roles

1. **Create Roles**:
   - Define roles (e.g., admin, user).
   - Assign permissions to these roles by selecting the corresponding checkboxes for module actions.

2. **Assign Roles to Users**:
   - Assign roles to users to determine their access levels.

### Permissions

1. **Define Permissions**:
   - Create permissions for actions on different modules (e.g., `product-create`, `order-delete`).

2. **Assign Permissions to Routes**:
   - Map permissions to specific frontend and backend routes.

### Backend Middleware

1. **Implement Middleware**:
   - Add middleware to the backend to protect routes.
   - Middleware checks if the user's role has the required permissions for access.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/permission-management-system.git

   Navigate to the project directory:



cd permission-management-system
Install dependencies:



npm install
Configuration
Backend Configuration:

Configure your backend to include the permission middleware.
Define modules, roles, and permissions in your backend database.
Frontend Configuration:

Ensure frontend routes are protected based on user permissions.
Implement logic to verify permissions before route access.
Usage
Create Modules and Actions:

Use the admin interface to define new modules and set actions.
Define and Assign Roles:

Create roles and assign corresponding permissions.
Link roles to users based on their access needs.
Manage Permissions:

Map permissions to frontend and backend routes to control access.
Example
Creating a Module:

Define a module called "Product Order".
Specify actions: Create, Delete, Update.
Creating a Role:

Define a role called "Admin".
Assign permissions: product-create, order-delete.
Assigning Role to User:

Link the "Admin" role to a user.
Access Control:

Implement route protection: Users with the product-create permission can access the "Create Product" route.

Contributions are welcome! Please submit issues or pull requests, and follow the coding guidelines. Ensure to include tests for new features.
