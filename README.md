# Permission Management System

Welcome to the Permission Management System project! This system provides a robust framework for managing module permissions, roles, and user access in both frontend and backend applications.

## Features

- **Module Creation**: Define modules with actions like create, delete, update.
- **Role Management**: Create roles and assign specific module actions to them.
- **Permission Assignment**: Map permissions to frontend and backend routes.
- **Access Control**: Enforce route access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Middleware Integration**: Implement backend middleware to validate permissions.

## Project Structure

### Modules

1. **Define Modules**:
   - Modules represent various features or entities (e.g., "Product Order").
   - Actions (e.g., create, delete, update) can be performed on these modules.

2. **Assign Actions**:
   - Specify actions that can be performed for each module.

### Roles

1. **Create Roles**:
   - Define roles (e.g., admin, user).
   - Assign permissions to these roles by selecting the corresponding checkboxes for module actions.

2. **Assign Roles to Users**:
   - Assign roles to users to determine their access levels.

### Permissions

1. **Define Permissions**:
   - Create permissions for actions on different modules (e.g., `product-create`, `order-delete`).

2. **Assign Permissions to Routes**:
   - Map permissions to specific frontend and backend routes.

### Backend Middleware

1. **Implement Middleware**:
   - Add middleware to the backend to protect routes.
   - Middleware checks if the user's role has the required permissions for access.
